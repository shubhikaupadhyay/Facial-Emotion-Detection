# Facial-Emotion-Detection

### About the Project:
The primary aim of this project is to employ image datasets to detect and analyze facial expressions. To achieve this, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is utilized for image classification. The classification task involves identifying and categorizing facial expressions into seven distinct types, namely angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. By leveraging the power of CNN, this project enables the accurate recognition and interpretation of various emotional states captured within facial images.
